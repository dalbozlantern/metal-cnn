# Metal-CNN

This project aims to automate the creative process of graphic logo design using deep learning techniques. This problem poses several unique challenges that complicate straight-forward training of an end-to-end generative model.

**Status**: This project is undergoing development. Data collection (web scraping), library cleaning and reformatting have been completed, and deep learning research is ongoing.

## Project motivation

The computerized automation of routine, creative outputs has the potential to benefit both producers and consumers of creative works. With the ability to automate steps within the artistic process, makers of creative content can reallocate their time and their efforts on high-level innovation rather than filling in “the details” of their vision. Consumers, on the other hand, stand to benefit from the decreased costs of artistic works.

Recent research in this field has focused largely on the generation of text outputs ranging from [journalism](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/03/artificla-intelligence-robot-reporter-pulitzer-prize) to forays in [political speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03313). This is in large part due to the existence of an easily accessible market for text-as-content: customers (and indirectly advertisers) are willing to pay for news articles, novels, and periodicals.

This stands in contrast to the lack of a comparably broad market for individual images. There are, however, several exceptions to this rule: notable among them is the market for branding and marketing materials, including corporate logos, which sometimes fetch quite high professional fees. Generating these branding plans currently requires many person-hours of conception, implementation, and iteration. The ability to automate all or part of this process would therefore represent a very attractive commercial target.
