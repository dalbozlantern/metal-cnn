===== BAND NAME CLEANING =====

93.1% of bands have an valid logo
98.6% of band names pass unicode screening
91.8% of band names pass both criteria

Some band names that didn't need unicode cleaning:
    Almighty Sathanas
    Brainstorm
    Crusader
    In Oath
    Meister Scheisze

Some band names that made the cut, but needed cleaning:
    Grimsvötn --> Grimsvotn
    Krüppel --> Kruppel
    Veïlhalt --> Veilhalt
    Hell Dörmer --> Hell Dormer
    Heboïdophrenie --> Heboidophrenie

Some band names that were cut:
    Планида
    Школа Коррекции
    降临
    Пламень
    唐朝

And, of course, my favorites:
    H₂O
    H₃O⁺
    H₂SO₄
Because nothing says "METAL" like a thorough understanding of Bronstead acididty.
